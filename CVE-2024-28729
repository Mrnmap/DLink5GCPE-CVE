Model:   DLink DWR 2000M 5G CPE With Wifi 6 Ax1800 | Version: DWR-2000M_1.34ME


Description: 
A critical security vulnerability has been identified in the Dlink DWR 2000M router's handling of WiFi SSID names, resulting in the injection of malicious XSS payloads. Due to the lack of input validation on WiFi SSID fields, attackers were able to inject payloads such as "<img src=x onerror=print()>" which executed arbitrary JavaScript code upon rendering the router's homepage. This vulnerability poses significant risks as it allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' web browsers whenever they access the compromised page



Step 1: Login to CPE and goto WiFi SSID creation Point 

Step 2 Create SSID with following XSS payload <img src =x onerror=print ()>

Step 3: Same payloads execute at home page whenever user login.
