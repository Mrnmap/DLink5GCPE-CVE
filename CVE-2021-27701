CVE-2021-27701 The application in question is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the absence of CSRF tokens and proper request validation. 
CSRF is a type of attack where a malicious user can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly submitting a request to a web application. In this case, the lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can alter or add user data on the portal, potentially gaining unauthorized control of user accounts.

No CSRF Token or Request Validation: The application does not use anti-CSRF tokens or proper request validation to distinguish legitimate user requests from malicious ones.
Crafted CSRF Request: An attacker can craft a malicious request to modify or add random user data. This crafted request is often embedded in a malicious link or action (e.g., a form submission or an image request) that targets a logged-in user.
Exploit the Trust of the Authenticated User: When the targeted user, who is already authenticated in the portal, unknowingly clicks on the malicious link or performs a specific action, their browser sends the request along with their session cookies, thus executing the attacker's malicious actions.
Modify/Add User Data: The attacker can use this vulnerability to:
Add new users to the system.
Modify existing user details, including critical data such as passwords, roles, or permissions.
Potentially take full control of a userâ€™s account by changing login credentials or account settings.
