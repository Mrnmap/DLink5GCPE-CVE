CVE-2021-27700:SOCIFI Guest Wi-Fi Portal (as SaaS) is a platform that provides guest Wi-Fi access management through a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. The portal is designed to help businesses manage guest Wi-Fi access, including features like login portals, user data collection, and more. However, a vulnerability has been identified in the Insecure Permissions within the platform.

In this case, any authorized customer with "Partner Mode" access is able to improperly access another customer's dashboard. This unauthorized access allows the attacker to perform a range of administrative actions, such as modifying user accounts, deleting users, and potentially viewing sensitive customer data.


The issue arises from improper access controls related to the "Partner Mode" permission level. Partner Mode is meant to give authorized users access to manage their own settings and data, but it inadvertently allows them to bypass restrictions and gain access to other customers' data within the same instance.

Steps for Exploitation:
Gain Access to Partner Mode: An attacker, already authorized as a customer with partner permissions, accesses their own dashboard.
Switch to Another Customer's Dashboard: Using an insecure URL or insufficient access controls, the attacker switches to the dashboard of another customer.
Perform Unauthorized Actions: Once inside the other customer's dashboard, the attacker can:
Modify user details (e.g., changing credentials, roles, or permissions).
Delete user accounts or data, potentially disrupting services or breaching confidentiality.
Access sensitive customer data depending on the level of access granted by the portal.

Impact

Data Breach: The attacker can potentially view and modify sensitive information, leading to data breaches.
Account Compromise: Attackers can delete or modify accounts, causing a denial of service or unauthorized activities on behalf of legitimate users.
Reputation Damage: Such vulnerabilities can severely damage the platform's reputation and trust with customers.
Compliance Violations: Depending on the industry, the exposure of user data might lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA).
